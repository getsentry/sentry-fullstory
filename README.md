# sentry-fullstory

The Sentry-FullStory integration seamlessly integrates the Sentry and FullStory platforms. When you look at a browser error in Sentry, you will see a link to the FullStory session replay at that exact moment in time. When you are watching a FullStory replay and your user experiences an error, you will see a link that will take you to that error in Sentry.

## Pre-Requisites

For the Sentry-FullStory integration to work, you must have the [Sentry browser SDK package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/browser) and the [FullStory browser SDK package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullstory/browser).

## Installation
To install the stable version:

with npm:
```
npm install --save @sentry/fullstory
```

with yarn:
```
yarn add @sentry/fullstory
```


## Setup

### Code Changes

To set up the integration, both FullStory and Sentry need to be initialized. Please add the following code:


```
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import * as FullStory from '@fullstory/browser';
import SentryFullStory from '@sentry/fullstory';

FullStory.init({ orgId: '__FULLSTORY_ORG_ID__' });

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '__DSN__',
  integrations: [ new SentryFullStory('__SENTRY_ORG_SLUG__'), ],
  // ...
});
  ```

Replace `__SENTRY_ORG_SLUG__` with the slug of your organization. You can get that value from the URL of your sentry organization. Example: `https://sentry.io/organizations/fullstory/` where `fullstory` would be the value of `__SENTRY_ORG_SLUG__`.


You also need to replace `__FULLSTORY_ORG_ID__` with the value of `_fs_org` in the FullStory recording snippet on your [FullStory settings page](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623514).


### Sentry Settings Change

In order for this integration to work properly, you need to whitelist the `fullStoryUrl` field in your Sentry settings. If you don't, the FullStory URL might be scrubbed because the session ID matches a credit card regex. To do this change, go to `Settings` -> `General`, find the heading `SECURITY & PRIVACY`, and add `fullStoryUrl` to the `Global Safe Fields` entry.

## How it works

In Sentry, you should see additional context of your error that has the `fullStoryUrl` below the breadcrumbs and other information:

In FullStory, you should see an event called `Sentry Error` on the right sidebar that has a link to the error in Sentry:
